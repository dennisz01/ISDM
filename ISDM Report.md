# Definition

## Project Objectives & Problem
The aim of this project is to deliver an end-to-end design for a Automated Call Routing System (ACRS) to the organisations call management center (CMC). This system will maximise efficiency by adjusting customer calls to relationship managers (RMs) with the domain knowledge of the potential / existing customer's profile. This will ensure that customers are matched with the most appropriate and well informed RM). The proposed system aims to improve the operational performance of the CMC by prioritising customer calls, performing customer-RM matching, and improving the outcomes of outbound telemarketing calls. In doing so, the system is projected to lift the organisations revenues in the 2019-20 fiscal year.

# Stakeholders
There are several stakeholders in this project. These include the customer that is to use the call center when dialing in, the RM that is to be matched alongside the system to assist users, and the travel company that is to operate this system.

# Design Thinking Processes

## POV Statements
`[User . . . (descriptive)] needs [Need . . . (verb)] because [Insight . . . (compelling)]`

Travel company who wants this new information system needs it to be reliable because downtime is costly in terms of money and customers

Customer who has a difficult problem needs a suitable and skilled RM because their problem may be complex

Customer who has a simple problem needs any available RM because their problem is very simple and easy to solve

RM who is busy and is in a call with another customer needs not to be disturbed by another call because theyâ€™re unavailable

RM who is waiting for inbound calls needs a list of outbound customers to call because they need to make sales during work hours

RM who is in call with a customer needs documents regarding the company's products and offers because they need to provide the customer with a wide range or accurate information.

## Assumptions
Several assumptions have been made in this project:
* There are improvements *needed* to be made to the call management center 
* There is an inherent *need* for the customer to utilise the call center services (i.e. they want to book holidays, make complaints)
* All stakeholders wholeheartedly agree to the project objectives and solution
* There are existing or new relationship managers
* The social and economic environment of stakeholders (e.g. customer's economic background)
