# Project Objectives & Problem

The aim of this project is to deliver an end-to-end design for a Automated Call Routing System (ACRS) to the organisations call management center (CMC). This system will maximise efficiency by adjusting customer calls to relationship managers (RMs) with the domain knowledge of the potential / existing customer's profile. This will ensure that customers are matched with the most appropriate and well informed RM). The proposed system aims to improve the operational performance of the CMC by prioritising customer calls, performing customer-RM matching, and improving the outcomes of outbound telemarketing calls. In doing so, the system is projected to lift the organisations revenues in the 2019-20 fiscal year.
