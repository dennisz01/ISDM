# Definition

## Project Objectives & Problem
The aim of this project is to deliver an end-to-end design for a Automated Call Routing System (ACRS) to the organisations call management center (CMC). This system will maximise efficiency by adjusting customer calls to relationship managers (RMs) with the domain knowledge of the potential / existing customer's profile. This will ensure that customers are matched with the most appropriate and well informed RM). The proposed system aims to improve the operational performance of the CMC by prioritising customer calls, performing customer-RM matching, and improving the outcomes of outbound telemarketing calls. In doing so, the system is projected to lift the organisations revenues in the 2019-20 fiscal year.

# Stakeholders
There are several stakeholders in this project. These include the customer that is to use the call center when dialing in, the RM that is to be matched alongside the system to assist users, and the travel company that is to operate this system.

# Design Thinking Processes
## Empathy Maps
### Customer

## POV Statements
`[User . . . (descriptive)] needs [Need . . . (verb)] because [Insight . . . (compelling)]`

Travel company who wants this new information system needs it to be reliable because downtime is costly in terms of money and customers

Travel company who requires this new information system needs it to improve the operational performance of their CMC because they want to increase their revenue for the 2019-20 fiscal year.

Travel company who will utilise this new information system needs it to integrate the Profiler Tool results because RMs need to be matched to customers in order to serve them efficiently and effectively.

Travel company who makes multiple travel packages needs the new information system to handle a high volume of these offers because RMs should be able to easily present them to customers.

Customer who has a difficult problem needs a suitable and skilled RM because their problem may be complex

Customer who has a simple problem needs any available RM because their problem is very simple and easy to solve

RM who is busy and is in a call with another customer needs not to be disturbed by another call because theyâ€™re unavailable

RM who is waiting for inbound calls needs a list of outbound customers to call because they need to make sales during work hours

RM who is in call with a customer needs documents regarding the company's products and offers because they need to provide the customer with a wide range or accurate information.

We have been contracted by a major travel company to improve the operational performance of their CMC. We noticed that the travel company isn't recording a growth in revenue during the 2019-20 fiscal year. We wonder if this means that the performance of the CMC impacts the fiscal year results. It would be game changing to improve the operational performance of the CMC using an information system.

We've heard from many RMs that they struggle to manage the various travel packages on offer. We were surprised to notice the number of travel packages produced by the travel company. We wonder if this means that customers are offered unnecessary packages by the RMs. It would be game changing to have RMs updated with new travel packages, that only apply to their customers, as soon as they are created.

We've met we many customers who that they hang up the call due to difficulties. We were surprised to noticed that the wait times for the call can be quite long. We wonder if this means that many potential buyers are missed in the queue. It would be game-changing to reduce the number of customers lost in the queue.

## Assumptions
Several assumptions have been made in this project:
* There are improvements *needed* to be made to the call management center 
* There is an inherent *need* for the customer to utilise the call center services (i.e. they want to book holidays, make complaints)
* All stakeholders wholeheartedly agree to the project objectives and solution
* There are existing or new relationship managers
* The social and economic environment of stakeholders (e.g. customer's economic background)

# Ideation

To solve the core problems defined in 

## How Might We Statements

1. How might we build a reliable system that is able to handle a large amount of calls

2. How might we reduce the wait time of customers with the most potential to purchase

3. How might we profile an RM so that we can recrod their area of expertise

4. How might we measure the performance of an RM

5. How might we handle large volumes of inbound customers

6. How might we help to reduce inbound call costs

7. How might we help RMs better understand their customers
